# Fnaf-discord-bot
A discord bot that will allow members to play fnaf

## Requirements
Five Nights at Freddy's (Obviously)
Pyautogui - ```python pip install pyautogui```
dotenv - ```python pip install python-dotenv```
discord - ```python pip install discord.py```

## Set-Up
Needs a user to create a discord bot and run the code on their machine, due to it moving the mouse
Discord developer portal - <https://discord.com/developers/applications>
A simple guide on making a disord bot - <https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/>
Create a .env file and add the values:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
DISCORD_GUILD=your-server-name
```
This is what will allow the bot to connect to your server

## Notes
The coord positions were made using my specific machine, I have not yet added functionality to change this with the bot yet so you will need to change this to work on your machine
Also Fnaf is funny with dual monitor set ups to person hosting will need to use a different machine to use the bot while the game is running
